# Required for Everyone

## 1. Allow Me to Introduce Myself :fireworks:
Hi everyone, my name is Neil Kuldip. When I started gaming, IGN was one of the first few places that I sought to use for wikis and guides when I started gaming at 15. I know, it’s kinda late, but what made that beginning experience fun was being able to become confident in my gameplay and reduce the amount of anxiety that comes with the turf of playing with experienced gamers. I vividly remember the hundreds of hours trying to find Korok seeds in Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and finally admitting that I needed a guide, IGN’s guide, to help me accomplish my task. Even for other games like Don’t Starve Together, and recaps on news in the gaming world, IGN became one of my main gaming news outlets. 

With that said, it means a lot to combine my love for gaming and programming to a company that has shaped some of the most memorable moments of my life. I would appreciate the opportunity to get my foot in the industry with the very company that made me confident in the first few years of playing a console.

## 2. Hisui's New Power Plant :zap:
At first was thinking that Voltorb would not be an ideal choice of Pokemon to power Hisui's power plant due to it's explosion that would be a risk to the village's infastructure. However after learning about the native Hisuain Voltorb, I have learned never to question the Professor.


### Thought Process to Solution

- **What is the average energy required to power Jubilife Village for a year?**
    For this problem, we will refer to the energy output per year as: ***E kWh/yr***
- **What is the average energy output for a typical Hisuian Voltorb?**
    Hisuian voltorbs can store electric current in its belly, making it the desired battery. However, it would be unwise to take into consideration that special attack stat will be important to the energy it generates since a higher stat means more damage, which translates to more damage in a typical battle. 
    For an average amount of energy, it is fair to assume the variable/units, ***Vb W***
    Voltorbs are of course living beings so we should consider how long a typical Voltorb can endure providing energy, ***T Wh/day***
    Since we considered the village's energy required for a day, our equation will consider ***Vby = Vb * T * 365 Wh/day***
- **So how many Voltorbs do we need then?**
    ***Total # of Voltorbs = E kWh/yr / Vby Wh/yr = E / Vby***
    
Special Considerations for Professor Laventon
- There will also need to be a separate facility for the voltorbs since they let out large laugh when they discharge, leading to noise pollution. 
- From my IGN sources, a Hisuian Voltorb can evolve with leaf stones and such Electrodes can produce more energy. Thus less Voltorbs would possibly be required.
